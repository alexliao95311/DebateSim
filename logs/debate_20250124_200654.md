## Judge Feedback

### Summary of Main Points:
- **Pro (User 1):** The user argues that supporting the International Criminal Court (ICC) gives the United States credibility on the global stage. This suggests that aligning with the ICC demonstrates a commitment to international law and justice.
- **Con (User 2):** The user counters that supporting the ICC could enable the court to target U.S. citizens, potentially harming them. This implies a concern over sovereignty and the risk of U.S. citizens being subjected to international prosecution.

### Feedback on Strengths and Weaknesses:
- **Pro (User 1):**
  - **Strengths:** The argument is concise and highlights a key benefit of supporting the ICCâ€”enhancing the U.S.'s global reputation and credibility.
  - **Weaknesses:** The argument is underdeveloped and lacks elaboration or evidence. It does not address potential counterarguments, such as the concerns raised by the Con side.

- **Con (User 2):**
  - **Strengths:** The argument raises a valid concern about the potential risks of ICC jurisdiction over U.S. citizens, which is a common critique of the court. It directly challenges the Pro position.
  - **Weaknesses:** Like the Pro, the argument is brief and lacks depth. It does not provide evidence or examples to substantiate the claim that U.S. citizens would be harmed.

### Decision on Who Won the Debate:
- **Winner: Con (User 2)**  
  While both arguments were underdeveloped, the Con side effectively raised a significant concern that directly challenges the Pro's position. The Pro's argument, while valid, was too vague and did not address the potential downsides of supporting the ICC. The Con's point about the risks to U.S. citizens carries weight in the debate, making their position stronger in this exchange. However, both sides would benefit from more detailed and evidence-based arguments in the future.
