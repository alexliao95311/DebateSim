[User Debater 1 (Pro), Round 1]: dogs are better because they rescue people
[User Debater 2 (Con), Round 1]: cats are better because they are more peaceful

[AI Judge]: **Summary of Main Points:**  
- **Pro (User Debater 1):** Argues that dogs are better because they rescue people, implying they are more useful and heroic.  
- **Con (User Debater 2):** Counters that cats are better because they are more peaceful, suggesting they provide a calmer and more harmonious presence.  

**Feedback on Strengths and Weaknesses:**  
- **Pro (User Debater 1):** Strength: Highlights a practical and emotionally compelling benefit of dogs (rescuing people). Weakness: Lacks elaboration or evidence to support the claim.  
- **Con (User Debater 2):** Strength: Presents a clear, contrasting benefit of cats (peacefulness). Weakness: Similarly lacks depth or evidence to substantiate the claim.  

**Decision:**  
**Con (User Debater 2) wins.** While both debaters made concise points, Con's argument about cats being more peaceful is more universally relatable and less dependent on specific scenarios (e.g., rescuing). Pro's point, while valid, is narrower in scope and lacks development.
