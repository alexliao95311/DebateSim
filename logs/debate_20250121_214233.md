## Debate Transcript


### Pro (User):
Our first argument is Economic Development

A lack of recognition deters investment in Somaliland despite investor interest

International relations specialist, Yusuf Idaan in 2024 explains that Without recognition, Somaliland is excluded from global economic forums, limiting funding and restricting growth. A lack of recognition discourages investors and restricts foreign investment.

As a result

UNICEF in 2022 sombers that more than 50% of Somaliland’s population is in poverty

Luckily when you affirm this changes in two ways,

First,
Christopher Clapham of Cambridge University contends that Recognition would exclude Somaliland from the extreme international sanctions imposed on it’s neighbor Somalia

To the same end,

 Joy Gordon of Yale found that sanctions have jeopardized 80% of Somalia’s economy.

But Second

Nikola Pijovic, a PhD in Political Science,  argues that recognition would increase foreign investment by strengthening infrastructure and increasing international trade

That’s crucial as

Researcher Ha Pham from last October concluded that In a study involving 90 countries, a 1% increase in foreign investment increases economic growth by 9%

This growth is a proven pathway to poverty reduction

Richard Adams, of the World Bank, reported increasing economic growth decreases poverty by 25%, without increasing inequality

Unless we take action

Professor Paul Muller in 2023 quantified that poverty is associated with a 71% excess risk for death

Our second argument is Food Aid

Aid to Somaliland is slow and insufficient --- recognition is necessary to solve a crisis

Journalist Jason Beaubien of NPR in 2017 wrote that Somaliland’s food crisis is one of the largest since 1945, and a million are at risk of starving. But a lack of recognition slows  aid and forces it to go through Somalia’s capital, 900 miles away, worsening delays.

Recognition allows direct aid delivery, combating famine and building long-term sustainability

Researcher Yograj Gautam in 2018 found that studies find food aid to have a positive effect, encouraging crop diversity and farming innovation.

The World Economic Forum in 2024 argues Global aid would unlock Africa’s trillion dollar food economy by promoting sustainability

Moreover, recognition addresses the root cause of hunger by enabling climate action

Abdi Musse of the Peace Institute in June wrote that Somaliland has developed policies but they face challenges in accessing funding from organizations like the Green Climate Fund due to a lack of recognition. 

Recognition enables action

It’s historically proven to work

Alemayehu of Texas University in 2024 argues that In Kenya resources from organizations like the Green Climate Fund, have decreased emissions and improved agriculture


Every second we wait is a nail in the coffin, inaction cannot be the answer

 Nancy McNally, a reporter with the CRS found that Somaliland faced its worst drought in 2 years, 6.2 million people are struggling to survive


For all those reasons,

Lord Alton of Liverpool University concludes that Recognition could unshackle Somaliland. Decreasing [long term] reliance on foreign aid, boosting domestic business and lifting millions out of poverty 

### Con (AI):
Thank you for your arguments. While the economic and humanitarian case for recognizing Somaliland may seem compelling at first glance, there are significant counterarguments that must be considered. I will address your points on economic development and food aid, providing evidence and reasoning to demonstrate why granting diplomatic recognition to Somaliland is not the optimal solution.

### **Rebuttal to Economic Development**

1. **Recognition Does Not Guarantee Economic Growth**  
   While you argue that recognition would spur foreign investment, the reality is that recognition alone does not automatically translate into economic prosperity. For example, South Sudan gained independence in 2011 with widespread international recognition, yet it remains one of the poorest and most unstable countries in the world. According to the World Bank in 2023, South Sudan’s GDP per capita is less than $300, and its economy is plagued by corruption, weak institutions, and ongoing conflict. This demonstrates that recognition without strong governance and infrastructure can fail to deliver economic benefits. Somaliland, while relatively stable compared to Somalia, still faces significant governance challenges that could hinder economic growth even with recognition.

2. **Risk of Regional Instability**  
   Granting recognition to Somaliland could destabilize the Horn of Africa. Somalia has consistently opposed Somaliland’s independence, and recognition by the African Union (AU) could exacerbate tensions, potentially leading to conflict. A 2023 report by the International Crisis Group warns that unilateral recognition of Somaliland could reignite territorial disputes and undermine peace efforts in the region. The AU’s primary mandate is to promote peace and stability, and recognizing Somaliland could directly contradict this goal.

3. **Economic Sanctions on Somalia Are Not a Barrier to Somaliland’s Growth**  
   You argue that recognition would shield Somaliland from sanctions imposed on Somalia, but this overlooks the fact that Somaliland already operates as a de facto independent state with its own economic systems. According to a 2022 report by the Heritage Foundation, Somaliland has established trade relationships with several countries, including Ethiopia and Djibouti, without formal recognition. The real barriers to economic growth are internal issues such as limited infrastructure, corruption, and a lack of diversification, not international sanctions.

---

### **Rebuttal to Food Aid**

1. **Recognition Is Not Necessary for Effective Aid Delivery**  
   While you claim that recognition would streamline food aid, the reality is that international organizations already operate in Somaliland without formal recognition. For example, the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF have been providing aid to Somaliland for decades through partnerships with local authorities. A 2023 WFP report highlights that the primary challenges to aid delivery in Somaliland are logistical issues and insecurity, not the lack of recognition. Recognition would not automatically solve these underlying problems.

2. **Direct Aid Delivery Could Undermine Somalia’s Sovereignty**  
   Granting recognition to Somaliland would undermine Somalia’s sovereignty and complicate efforts to rebuild the Somali state. The AU has consistently supported Somalia’s territorial integrity, and recognizing Somaliland would set a dangerous precedent for other secessionist movements across the continent. A 2024 study by the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) warns that such a move could embolden separatist groups in places like Cabinda (Angola) or Southern Cameroon, leading to widespread instability.

3. **Climate Action Does Not Require Recognition**  
   You argue that recognition would enable Somaliland to access climate funding, but this is not entirely accurate. Many non-state entities and subnational regions receive funding from international organizations without formal recognition. For example, the Green Climate Fund has provided grants to regional governments in countries like Brazil and India. Somaliland could pursue similar avenues without requiring full diplomatic recognition. The real issue is capacity-building and governance, not recognition.

---

### **Broader Implications**

1. **AU’s Commitment to Territorial Integrity**  
   The African Union has long upheld the principle of territorial integrity, as enshrined in its Constitutive Act. Recognizing Somaliland would violate this principle and could lead to a domino effect of secessionist movements across Africa. A 2023 report by the African Centre for Strategic Studies highlights that there are over 20 active separatist movements on the continent. Granting recognition to Somaliland could destabilize the entire region.

2. **Diplomatic Fallout with Somalia**  
   Somalia is a member state of the AU, and recognizing Somaliland would strain diplomatic relations with Mogadishu. This could undermine broader efforts to stabilize Somalia and the region. According to a 2024 analysis by Chatham House, Somalia’s cooperation is essential for combating terrorism and piracy in the Horn of Africa. Alienating Somalia could have severe security consequences.

---

### **Conclusion**

While the economic and humanitarian challenges facing Somaliland are undeniable, granting diplomatic recognition is not the solution. Recognition does not guarantee economic growth, risks regional instability, and undermines the AU’s commitment to territorial integrity. Instead, the international community should focus on supporting Somaliland through existing frameworks, such as increased aid, capacity-building, and regional partnerships, without formal recognition. This approach addresses the immediate needs of Somaliland’s population while preserving the stability and unity of the Horn of Africa.

Rebuttal
On Econ 
1. You say South Sudan is still poor and corrupted after recognition but that’s cherry picking an isolated incident - South Sudan is still an authoritarian regime and is nowhere close to the democracy and stability Somaliland has today - Somaliland already has a democracy and a stable economy, recognition would only boost that, while South Sudan started off corrupted and unstable, which is why it is still suffering. Your response doesn’t provide a warrant as to why the recognition doesn’t guarantee economic growth. 
2. You say destabilize the Horn of Africa such as territorial disputes and stuff, but you yourself say that the AU’s primary goal is to promote peace and stability - they will most definitely host negotiations and talks with Somalia and other countries in the Horn of Africa to help mediate the secession - preventing instability. Additionally, other countries would help with lowering tensions and mediating talks, such as when Turkey resolved tensions during Ethiopia’s MoU. 
3. You say Somaliland already has deals with other countries, but it’s obviously not enough if over 50% of it’s population is poverty - recognition would still greatly boost trade deals and benefit the economy and people. You say Somaliland isn’t affected by Somalia’s sanctions but that just isn’t true - many of Somaliland’s and and trade goes through Somalia’s capital, which is definitely affected - also our evidence is pretty clear there and you don’t provide counter evidence

On food aid
1. Sure UNICEF and WFP are already providing aid but it’s obviously not enough - 6.2 million people are starving. The WFP report highlights insecurity which is exactly our argument - because aid has to get rerouted through Somalia’s capital, that is the logistical issue and security issue as terrorists like Al-Shabaab and corruption weaken the aid’s effect.
2. Undermining sovereignty was already covered before - it wouldn’t lead to stability as mentioned before
3. Your only example of GCF giving grants were all independent countries - which proves our point. 

On the broader implications
- This wouldn’t break AU’s commitment to territorial integrity as Somaliland has already been operating as a de-facto state for a long time, nothing territory wise changes in the affirmative world.
- The diplomatic fallout and backlash argument was already addressed. 

### Con (AI):
**Rebuttal to the Pro Side:**

**On Economic Arguments:**

1. **Cherry-Picking South Sudan:** While it is true that South Sudan is an extreme example, it is not an isolated incident. The recognition of new states often leads to economic instability, not just in South Sudan but in other cases like Kosovo and East Timor. According to the World Bank, Kosovo's GDP growth has been erratic, and unemployment remains high at around 25% as of 2023. East Timor, despite its oil wealth, still struggles with poverty and economic diversification. These examples suggest that recognition does not automatically guarantee economic stability or growth. Somaliland's current stability is not a guarantee of future prosperity post-recognition, especially given the potential for increased regional tensions and the diversion of resources to security rather than economic development.

2. **Destabilization of the Horn of Africa:** The African Union's primary goal is indeed to promote peace and stability, but recognizing Somaliland could set a dangerous precedent that undermines this very goal. The AU has consistently upheld the principle of territorial integrity, as seen in its stance on Western Sahara. Recognizing Somaliland could encourage other secessionist movements across the continent, such as in Cameroon's Anglophone regions or Nigeria's Biafra, leading to widespread instability. The AU's mediation efforts, while well-intentioned, may not be sufficient to prevent the escalation of conflicts that could arise from such a precedent.

3. **Trade and Sanctions:** While Somaliland does have some trade deals, recognition does not automatically translate into significant economic benefits. For example, Taiwan, despite having diplomatic recognition from a few countries, still faces significant economic challenges due to its limited international recognition. Somaliland's trade routes through Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, are indeed affected by sanctions and insecurity, but recognition could exacerbate these issues by leading to a breakdown in relations with Somalia, further complicating trade routes and economic stability.

**On Food Aid:**

1. **Insufficient Aid:** While it is true that 6.2 million people are starving, the solution is not necessarily recognition. The logistical and security issues you mention are real, but they are not unique to Somaliland. For example, in Yemen, despite international recognition, aid delivery remains a significant challenge due to ongoing conflict and insecurity. Recognition of Somaliland could lead to increased conflict with Somalia, further complicating aid delivery. Instead of recognition, the international community should focus on improving aid delivery mechanisms and addressing the root causes of insecurity in the region.

2. **Undermining Sovereignty:** The argument that recognition would not lead to stability is well-founded. The breakup of states often leads to prolonged conflict, as seen in the case of Yugoslavia. The international community's recognition of new states in the Balkans led to years of war and instability. Recognizing Somaliland could similarly lead to prolonged conflict with Somalia, undermining the very stability that the AU seeks to promote.

3. **GCF Grants:** The fact that GCF grants are given to independent countries does not prove that recognition is the solution. Many non-recognized entities receive international aid and support without formal recognition. For example, Palestine, despite not being a fully recognized state, receives significant international aid. The key is not recognition but effective governance and international support, which Somaliland can receive without formal recognition.

**On Broader Implications:**

1. **Territorial Integrity:** The argument that Somaliland has been operating as a de facto state does not negate the importance of territorial integrity. The AU's commitment to this principle is crucial for maintaining stability across the continent. Recognizing Somaliland would undermine this principle and could lead to a domino effect of secessionist movements, destabilizing the entire region.

2. **Diplomatic Fallout:** The diplomatic fallout from recognizing Somaliland would be significant. Somalia, a member of the AU, would likely oppose such a move, leading to a breakdown in relations not just between Somalia and Somaliland, but potentially between Somalia and other AU member states. This could lead to a broader diplomatic crisis within the AU, undermining its ability to function effectively.

In conclusion, while the arguments for recognizing Somaliland are compelling, the potential risks and broader implications for regional stability and the AU's principles of territorial integrity and peace are too significant to ignore. The AU should focus on supporting Somaliland's development and stability without formal recognition, thereby avoiding the potential for increased conflict and instability in the Horn of Africa.

### Decision on Who Won the Debate:

**Winner: Pro (User)**

**Reasoning:**
The Pro side presented a more compelling and evidence-based case, effectively linking recognition to tangible benefits such as economic growth, poverty reduction, and improved food aid delivery. The Pro’s rebuttals were strong, particularly in addressing the Con’s concerns about regional instability and governance challenges. While the Con raised valid points about the risks of recognition, the Pro successfully argued that Somaliland’s unique stability and democratic governance make it a viable candidate for recognition, and that the AU and international community could mediate potential tensions. The Pro’s focus on the immediate humanitarian and economic benefits of recognition, supported by credible evidence, ultimately outweighed the Con’s broader but less substantiated concerns about regional instability and AU principles.
