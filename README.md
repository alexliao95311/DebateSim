# DebateSim: AI-Powered Debate Simulation

DebateSim is an innovative website designed to simulate debate scenarios using artificial intelligence. This tool allows users to explore the dynamics of debates by enabling AI to take on roles such as debaters, judges, or both. Whether youâ€™re a student, coach, or debate enthusiast, DebateSim provides an interactive and educational platform to enhance critical thinking, argumentation, and decision-making skills. 

# Features
- **AI Debaters**: Simulate debates with AI participants capable of representing opposing viewpoints.
- **AI Judges**: Let the AI evaluate debates based on structured criteria, offering feedback and scoring.
- **User-Controlled Interaction**: Choose the roles for AI (debaters, judges, or both) while optionally participating as a debater or judge.
- **Customizable Topics**: Input any debate resolution or topic for tailored simulations.
- **Debate Formats**: Supports popular formats such as Lincoln-Douglas, Public Forum, or custom styles.
- **Scoring and Feedback**: Provides in-depth feedback on arguments, counterarguments, and debate strategies. 

# Usage
1. Run the simulation
2. Choose a mode:
- AI as both debaters and judge (full simulation)
- AI as debaters, user as judge
- AI as judge, users as debaters
- AI as judge and debater, user as other debater
3. Input Debate Parameters:
- Select a format (e.g. Free-for-all crossfire, LD, PF, CX, etc.)
- Provide a debate resolution or topic
4.	Interact with the Simulation:
- View arguments, counterarguments, and judge decisions.
- Pause, rewind, or modify debates dynamically.

# Example
1.	Start DebateSim
2.	Select a mode: AI as both debaters and judge
3.	Enter a debate topic: "Resolved: Artificial Intelligence will do more harm than good in the next decade."
4.	Watch the debate unfold:
[AI Debater 1]: Opening Statement...
[AI Debater 2]: Rebuttal...
5.	Review judge feedback: [AI Judge] - Based on logical coherence, evidence, and rhetorical skill...
