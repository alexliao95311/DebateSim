## Problem Statement and Motivation

### The Challenge of Democratic Discourse

In an era of increasing polarization and declining civic engagement, quality democratic discourse has become critically endangered. Several key challenges motivated the development of DebateSim:

1. **Educational Gap**: Students and educators lack accessible tools for practicing structured argumentation and debate skills
2. **Legislative Complexity**: Citizens struggle to understand complex legislative documents and their implications  
3. **Bias and Echo Chambers**: Limited exposure to well-reasoned opposing viewpoints reinforces existing beliefs
4. **Accessibility Barriers**: Traditional debate formats require significant resources, scheduling, and expertise
5. **Lack of Objective Analysis**: Human bias often clouds debate evaluation and feedback

### Our Vision

DebateSim addresses these challenges by democratizing access to high-quality debate experiences through AI technology. The platform aims to:

- **Enhance Critical Thinking**: Provide structured environments for developing argumentation skills
- **Increase Civic Engagement**: Make legislative analysis accessible to everyday citizens
- **Combat Misinformation**: Offer fact-based, multi-perspective analysis of complex issues
- **Scale Educational Impact**: Enable simultaneous debate experiences for unlimited users
- **Preserve Democratic Values**: Maintain human agency while leveraging AI assistance

## Approach, Methodologies, and AI Techniques

### Multi-Modal AI Architecture

Our approach combines several advanced AI techniques to create a comprehensive debate ecosystem:

#### 1. **Large Language Model Integration**
- **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI GPT-4, Meta LLaMA, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Automatic fallback and optimization based on task requirements
- **Custom Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for debating, judging, and analysis

#### 2. **Structured Debate Generation**


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- OpenRouter API key
- Firebase project (for authentication)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
