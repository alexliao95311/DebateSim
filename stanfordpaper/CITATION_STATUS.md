## 🔍 **Issue Diagnosis**

The citations appear to be missing because:

1. **LaTeX Not Installed**: The system doesn't have pdflatex installed
2. **Compilation Required**: Citations need to be processed by BibTeX to appear in the final PDF

## 🛠️ **Solution**

To see the citations properly, you need to:

1. **Install LaTeX** (e.g., MacTeX on macOS):
   ```bash
   brew install --cask mactex
   ```

2. **Compile the paper** with proper citation processing:
   ```bash
   pdflatex neurips_paper_template.tex
   bibtex neurips_paper_template
   pdflatex neurips_paper_template.tex
   pdflatex neurips_paper_template.tex
   ```
