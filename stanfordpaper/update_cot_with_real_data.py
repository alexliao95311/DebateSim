            ### 1. Historical Justice
            First, we must acknowledge that H.R. 40 addresses centuries of systemic discrimination. The bill establishes a commission to study the lasting effects of slavery and Jim Crow laws. This is important because understanding historical context is crucial for addressing current inequalities.
            
            ### 2. Economic Impact
            Second, reparations would have significant economic benefits. Studies show that closing the racial wealth gap would add trillions to the economy. The commission would analyze these economic impacts thoroughly, considering both direct payments and systemic reforms.
            
            ### 3. Social Healing
            Finally, this process would promote national reconciliation. By officially acknowledging past injustices, we can begin healing the wounds that continue to divide our nation. The commission's work would provide a foundation for meaningful dialogue and understanding.

            After carefully analyzing this debate, I will evaluate each side's performance.
            
            First, the Pro side presented strong historical arguments with specific evidence from the bill text. Their economic analysis was well-reasoned and supported by data. However, they could have addressed more counterarguments.
            
            Second, the Con side raised valid practical concerns about implementation costs and legal challenges. Their arguments were logically structured, but they lacked sufficient evidence to support their economic projections.

            First, your argument structure was clear, but you need to integrate more specific evidence. The bill text provides excellent support for your position - use direct quotes more frequently.
            
            Second, your rebuttals were effective but could be more systematic. Address each of your opponent's arguments point-by-point rather than grouping them together.
            
            Third, your conclusion was strong, but consider adding more weighing analysis. Explain why your arguments outweigh your opponent's concerns.
            
            Overall, you showed good reasoning skills and clear communication. Focus on evidence integration and systematic rebuttals for improvement.
