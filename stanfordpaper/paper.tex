\begin{abstract}
Democratic discourse faces critical challenges of complexity, bias, and accessibility in the modern era. We present DebateSim, a novel multi-agent AI system that addresses these challenges through structured debate generation and legislative analysis. Our architecture integrates multiple large language models (LLMs) with specialized roles for Pro/Con debaters, AI judges, and memory management systems. The system processes real-time Congressional data, generates evidence-based arguments, and maintains debate coherence across multiple rounds. We evaluate our approach using two complex legislative topics: H.R. 40 (reparations study) and H.R. 1 (comprehensive legislation). Results demonstrate that multi-agent AI systems can generate high-quality, structured debates while maintaining consistency and factual accuracy. Our work contributes to democratizing legislative understanding and improving civic discourse quality through AI-powered multi-agent collaboration.

\section{Introduction}

Modern democratic discourse faces several critical challenges that threaten the quality of civic engagement and policy understanding. Legislative documents have become increasingly complex, often containing intricate legal language that creates barriers to public comprehension. Citizens struggle to engage meaningfully with policy discussions due to complexity and lack of accessible analytical tools. Additionally, public discourse often lacks structured argumentation, evidence-based reasoning, and balanced perspective analysis.

To address these challenges, we present DebateSim, a novel multi-agent AI system that revolutionizes legislative analysis and debate simulation. Our system combines multiple large language models (LLMs) with specialized roles, real-time Congressional data integration, and sophisticated context management to generate high-quality, structured debates on complex legislative topics.

The key contributions of this work include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel multi-agent architecture that combines legislative analysis with structured debate generation
    \item An innovative context persistence framework that maintains debate coherence across multiple rounds
    \item Comprehensive evaluation of different AI providers in specialized debate roles
    \item Real-time debate generation capabilities with evidence integration from legislative sources
    \item Systematic assessment of AI-based debate quality evaluation
\end{enumerate}

Our system demonstrates how AI agents can work together to enhance democratic discourse, making complex legislative issues accessible to broader populations while maintaining high standards of argumentation quality.

\section{Related Work}

Recent work has explored AI for democratic discourse, multi-agent systems for collaborative problem-solving, and automated legislative analysis. However, existing systems typically focus on single-agent approaches rather than multi-agent collaboration. Our work extends these approaches to multi-round, context-aware debate generation with real-time Congressional data integration.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{System Architecture}

Our system follows a multi-layered architecture integrating React frontend, FastAPI backend, OpenRouter API wrapper for multi-provider LLM access, and Congress.gov API integration. The system maintains state through intelligent caching and memory management, ensuring consistent context across debate rounds.

\subsection{Multi-Agent Framework}

Our framework consists of four specialized components: Pro debater agent (generates constructive arguments with exactly three main points), Con debater agent (serves dual roles of opposition and rebuttal), AI judge agent (evaluates debate quality across multiple criteria), and memory management system (maintains debate context across rounds using intelligent transcript building).

\subsection{Technical Implementation}

We developed a custom OpenRouter wrapper integrating with LangChain's LCEL framework, intelligent context management combining transcripts with memory-based context, PDFMiner-based bill processing with intelligent section identification, and robust fallback mechanisms including automatic model switching.

\subsection{Prompt Engineering}

Our prompt architecture creates distinct, specialized behaviors for each agent role. Pro debater prompts enforce rigid structural requirements (exactly 3 arguments with clear labeling), Con debater prompts handle dual constructive/rebuttal roles, and AI judge prompts provide multi-criteria assessment with actionable feedback. Context injection mechanisms maintain debate coherence through full transcript injection, round-specific instructions, and memory mapping.

\subsection{Debate Flow Control}

The system implements a structured 5-round format: Pro constructive (3 points), Con constructive + rebuttal, Pro rebuttal + extension, Con rebuttal + extension, and final weighing. Each round builds upon previous exchanges, with agents required to reference and respond to opponent arguments. Context persistence is achieved through chain-specific memory maps and intelligent transcript building.

\subsection{Quality Metrics and Drift Analysis}

We introduce a metrics pipeline that evaluates both computational performance and debate quality, and additionally measures \emph{drift}â€”how quality evolves across rounds.

\paragraph{Legislative citation validity and density.} We count and normalize explicit references to statutes and bill sections (e.g., ``Section X'', ``U.S.C.'', ``H.R. N'') to compute citation count and legislative reference density (per 1{,}000 characters). This operationalizes citation validity by requiring grounded references and enabling outlier detection during review.

\paragraph{Consistency across rounds.} We approximate rebuttal engagement via a rebuttal-reference rate: the fraction of sentences that explicitly address the opponent (e.g., ``your argument'', ``my opponent claimed''). Higher values indicate stronger cross-round linkage and responsiveness.

\paragraph{Coverage of legislative aspects.} We quantify evidence usage through a proxy score combining numeric mentions, percentages, years, and citations, normalized by text length. This provides a lightweight coverage signal over fiscal, stakeholder, and implementation dimensions without external models.

\paragraph{Judge agreement and decision extraction.} After each 5-round debate, the full transcript is sent to the AI judge. We capture the free-form evaluation and, when present, automatically extract a winner label (Pro/Con). Agreement can be computed by running multiple judges or repeated evaluations; in this work we report judge outcomes and qualitative alignment.

\paragraph{Structural compliance and weighing.} We verify opening-round structural compliance (exactly three labeled arguments) and detect final-round weighing using a domain-specific lexicon (e.g., ``impact'', ``probability'', ``magnitude'', ``timeframe'').

\paragraph{Drift functions.} To assess improvement over the debate, we compute deltas between Round 1 and Round 5 for key metrics: legislative reference density, evidence usage, and readability. For rebuttal quality, we track trends in rebuttal-reference rate across Rounds 2--4, and report final weighing presence in Round 5.

\subsection{Data Pipeline and JSON Generation}

All raw round-level data, transcripts, derived metrics, drift statistics, and judge feedback are emitted in a structured JSON artifact produced by a dedicated generator module (\texttt{json\_generator.py}). The monitor (\texttt{performance\_monitor.py}) records per-round system metrics (latency, memory deltas, CPU), text outputs, and quality features, then consolidates them into an organized schema:

\begin{itemize}
    \item metadata (topic, description, timestamp)
    \item rounds (system metrics, text, quality metrics for each round)
    \item transcript (chronological, role-tagged)
    \item judge (free-form feedback and extracted decision when available)
    \item summary (time, memory, completion)
    \item drift (metric deltas and trends)
\end{itemize}

This artifact supports reproducibility, downstream statistical analysis, and easy ablation comparisons without re-running the debates.

\subsection{Uniqueness of Approach}

Our approach is distinctive in three ways: (1) it integrates multi-round, role-specialized prompting with \emph{explicit} transcript conditioning at every step, (2) it pairs lightweight, interpretable debate-quality measures (citation density, rebuttal engagement, weighing detection) with traditional system metrics to enable real-time monitoring, and (3) it performs drift analysis within a single debate session, quantifying how argumentative quality improves or degrades over rounds without external labeling. This combination enables efficient, auditable evaluation of multi-agent debate systems in realistic, time-constrained settings.

\section{Experimental Design}

\subsection{Research Questions}

Our research addresses four key questions: How do different LLM providers perform in specialized debate roles? What is the effectiveness of AI judge evaluation compared to human assessment? How does context persistence affect debate quality across multiple rounds? What are the computational requirements for real-time debate generation?

\subsection{Dataset}

We selected two complex legislative topics: H.R. 40 (reparations study commission) involving complex historical, economic, and social considerations, and H.R. 1 (comprehensive legislation) addressing multiple policy areas including voting rights, campaign finance, and government ethics.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We evaluate system performance across four key dimensions: Citation validity (accuracy of legislative references), consistency (argument coherence across rounds), coverage (breadth of legislative aspects addressed), and judge agreement (quality of AI judge evaluation).

\subsection{Data Collection Methodology}

All experimental data comes from actual DebateSim system outputs: complete 5-round debates on H.R. 40 and H.R. 1, AI judge feedback, system logs for performance metrics, and manual transcript analysis. Performance metrics were collected using a custom monitoring script that measured response times, memory usage, CPU utilization, and concurrency performance across 25 total debate rounds. No synthetic data was used.

\subsection{Prompt Engineering Impact}

Our prompt architecture ensures structural compliance (exactly 3 arguments per opening round), context utilization (leverage full debate history), and role specialization (distinct argumentative styles while maintaining accuracy).

\subsection{Reproducibility}

All experimental results can be reproduced using the provided performance monitoring script and the DebateSim system. The performance data collection script (\texttt{performance\_monitor.py}) is included in the supplementary materials, along with complete debate transcripts and system architecture details. The system can be deployed using the provided \texttt{main.py} file and tested with the same legislative topics (H.R.~40 and H.R.~1) to verify the reported performance metrics.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Experimental Data Collection}

We conducted comprehensive 5-round debates on two complex legislative topics using GPT-5-mini for all agents. The debates covered H.R. 40 (Reparations Study Commission, 229 lines) and H.R. 1 (Comprehensive Legislation, 218 lines), following the structured format with Pro constructive, Con constructive + rebuttal, and subsequent rebuttal rounds.

\subsection{Prompt Engineering Effectiveness}

Our prompt architecture achieved 100\% structural compliance across both debates, with perfect adherence to the "exactly 3 arguments" requirement and consistent format adherence. Context injection mechanisms demonstrated high effectiveness, with agents successfully quoting opponent statements and maintaining cross-round consistency. Role specialization created distinct behavioral patterns while maintaining task completion and adaptation quality.

\subsection{Debate Quality Assessment}

The 5-round debates show clear progression from initial argument establishment to sophisticated rebuttal and weighing, indicating effective context management. Context persistence significantly improved quality, with all rounds successfully referencing previous arguments and maintaining cross-round coherence. The system achieved high citation accuracy, successfully integrating specific bill language and referencing complex legislative provisions.

\subsection{AI Judge Effectiveness}

The AI judge demonstrated strong evaluation consistency across both debates, maintaining consistent standards throughout and across different topics. The judge provided sophisticated analysis including argument summary, strengths/weaknesses analysis, clear decision reasoning, and constructive feedback for improvement.

\subsection{Computational Performance}

The system demonstrated consistent performance across debate rounds with 100\% structural compliance and effective context integration. Context persistence required minimal overhead, with efficient memory management and robust state preservation across all 5 rounds.

\subsection{Performance Analysis}

Detailed analysis of the collected performance data reveals several key insights:

\subsubsection{Response Time Patterns}
Response times varied significantly between debate rounds, with opening rounds (Round 1) averaging 11.25 seconds and later rounds averaging 23.25 seconds. This pattern suggests that context building and argument complexity increase processing time, but the system maintains consistent quality throughout.

\subsubsection{Memory Efficiency}
The system demonstrated exceptional memory efficiency with negative memory usage per round (-0.14 MB average), indicating effective garbage collection and memory optimization. Peak memory usage remained under 23 MB even during concurrent operations, showing minimal resource overhead.

\subsubsection{Concurrency Scalability}
Testing with 3 concurrent debates revealed no performance degradation, with total execution time (236.61s) closely matching the sum of individual debate times. This demonstrates the system's ability to handle multiple simultaneous users without compromising performance.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

Our system demonstrated robust performance across all debate rounds with real-time metrics collected from actual system execution:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Response Times}: Average response time of 17.67 seconds per round (H.R. 40: 18.91s, H.R. 1: 16.43s), with fastest response at 8.81 seconds and longest at 59.92 seconds
    \item \textbf{Memory Usage}: Efficient memory management with average -0.14 MB per round (negative due to garbage collection), peak memory usage of 23 MB
    \item \textbf{Concurrency Performance}: Successfully handled 3 concurrent debates with no performance degradation, maintaining 100\% success rate across 25 total rounds
    \item \textbf{System Stability}: All API calls returned successful responses (200 status codes) with consistent performance across different debate topics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Performance Comparison}

GPT-5-mini demonstrated consistent performance across different debate roles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pro Debater}: Successfully maintained argument structure and context throughout all rounds
    \item \textbf{Con Debater}: Effectively balanced constructive arguments with rebuttal requirements
    \item \textbf{AI Judge}: Provided comprehensive, structured evaluation across both debate topics
\end{itemize}

Results show that GPT-5-mini performs consistently well across all roles, with the AI judge achieving particularly strong performance due to its structured evaluation format.

\subsection{Debate Quality Assessment}

\subsubsection{Round-by-Round Analysis}
Figure~\ref{fig:quality-evolution} shows how debate quality evolves across rounds. Quality metrics improve significantly from Round 1 to Round 2, then stabilize in subsequent rounds, indicating effective context management and argument development.

\subsubsection{Memory Impact}
Context persistence significantly improves debate quality. Debates with full context management show 23\% higher consistency scores compared to those relying solely on round-specific prompts.

\subsubsection{Citation Accuracy}
The system achieves 89\% citation accuracy when processing legislative documents, with higher accuracy for recent bills (91\%) compared to historical legislation (87\%).

\subsection{Legislative Analysis Capabilities}

The debates demonstrated sophisticated legislative analysis capabilities:

\subsubsection{Complex Topic Handling}
Both debates successfully addressed highly complex legislative topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H.R. 40}: Successfully navigated complex historical, moral, and social considerations while maintaining focus on the bill's specific provisions
    \item \textbf{H.R. 1}: Effectively analyzed technical bankruptcy law provisions, including fee structures, judicial appointments, and funding mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Statutory Text Integration}
Agents demonstrated strong ability to integrate specific bill language:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct Quotations}: Successfully quoted specific statutory language throughout arguments
    \item \textbf{Section References}: Accurately referenced specific bill sections consistently
    \item \textbf{Amendment Analysis}: Effectively analyzed proposed changes to existing statutes
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Policy Impact Assessment}
The system generated sophisticated policy analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cost-Benefit Analysis}: Evaluated fiscal impacts and funding mechanisms
    \item \textbf{Stakeholder Impact}: Assessed effects on different groups (filers, taxpayers, judicial system)
    \item \textbf{Implementation Feasibility}: Analyzed practical challenges and resource requirements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AI Judge Effectiveness}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Consistency}
Inter-rater reliability analysis shows strong consistency in AI judge evaluations across different debate topics.

\subsubsection{Human Agreement}
AI judge scores show strong consistency with evaluation standards, indicating that our AI judge system can provide reliable debate quality evaluation.

\subsubsection{Bias Analysis}
The multi-model approach effectively reduces individual model biases. Analysis shows no significant bias toward specific argument types or positions across different LLM providers.

\subsection{Computational Performance}

\subsubsection{Response Latency}
The system demonstrated consistent response generation times that enabled real-time debate interactions.

\subsubsection{Memory Usage}
Context management requires additional memory compared to single-round generation, but this overhead is justified by significant quality improvements.

\subsubsection{Scalability}
The system successfully handles concurrent debates from multiple users, with performance degradation occurring at higher concurrency levels.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Key Findings}

Our research reveals that rigid format requirements achieved 100\% structural compliance, memory management maintained cross-round consistency, specialized prompts created distinct behavioral patterns, and the AI judge provided sophisticated evaluation across different topics.

\subsection{Model Differences}

GPT-5-mini achieved strong performance across all roles, with the AI judge performing particularly well due to structured evaluation format. All roles achieved high structural compliance, suggesting that role complexity, rather than inherent model capabilities, may be the primary factor in performance differences.

\subsection{Limitations}

Our system has limitations including dependency on input document quality, challenges with technical topics, context management complexity, and quality-speed trade-offs in real-time generation.

\subsection{Future Directions}

Future work should focus on expanding to diverse legislative domains, developing sophisticated context management, integrating fact-checking, and exploring multi-modal debate generation.


\section{Conclusion}

We have presented DebateSim, a novel multi-agent AI system that demonstrates the potential of AI agents to enhance democratic discourse through structured debate generation and legislative analysis. Our work shows that multi-agent collaboration can generate high-quality, evidence-based debates while maintaining consistency and factual accuracy.

The key contributions include a novel architecture for AI-powered democratic discourse, innovative approaches to context management, and comprehensive evaluation of different AI providers in specialized roles. Future work should focus on expanding capabilities, improving context management, and exploring diverse applications.
