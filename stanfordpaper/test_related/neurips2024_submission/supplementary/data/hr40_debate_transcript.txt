AI Debater Pro - Round 1/5
Model: openai/gpt-5-mini

1. Moral and historical obligation
The bill states "approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their descendants were enslaved in the United States..." and finds that "the slavery ... constituted an immoral and inhumane deprivation of Africans' life, liberty..." Quoting the statute grounds a national moral responsibility. Recognizing this factual record is the prerequisite for legitimate remedial policy and national reconciliation.

2. Evidence‑based policymaking mechanism
The bill states Section 3(b)(1): the Commission shall "Identify, compile and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation..." and Section 3(c) requires a report to Congress within one year. A dedicated commission ensures rigorous fact‑finding, cross‑disciplinary analysis, and legally defensible recommendations rather than ad hoc political claims.

3. Structured path to concrete remedies
The bill states the Commission shall "Recommend appropriate remedies" and explicitly require consideration of "how the Government... will offer a formal apology" and "how any form of compensation... is calculated" (Section 3(b)(7)(B),(E)). That mandate creates a clear, accountable process for transforming historical findings into practicable policy solutions.

These provisions make H.R.40 the responsible, evidence‑driven starting point for addressing longstanding harms.

1. Biased commission composition
The bill states "Six members shall be selected from the major civil society and reparations organizations that have historically championed the cause of reparatory justice" (Section 4(a)(1)(D)). That explicit selection favors a single viewpoint and undermines claims of impartial fact‑finding, risking politically skewed recommendations.

2. Unrealistic timeline and overly broad scope
The bill requires the Commission to submit a report "not later than the date which is one year after the date of the first meeting" (Section 3(c)). Coupled with its mandate to study the "capture... transport... sale... treatment" and "lingering negative effects" (Section 3(b)(1),(5)), one year is insufficient for comprehensive, multi‑century analysis.

3. Insufficient funding and vague remedy standards
The bill authorizes only "$12,000,000" (Section 8) while demanding study of national institutions and compensation formulas ("How... any form of compensation... is calculated" (Section 3(b)(7)(E))). The funding and vague criteria make sound, defensible recommendations unlikely.

" The bill states "approximately 4,000,000 Africans..." and finds that "the slavery ... constituted an immoral and inhumane deprivation of Africans' life, liberty..." —" Quoting moral findings does not address structural biases in the Commission's design or practical feasibility.

" The bill states Section 3(b)(1): the Commission shall 'Identify, compile and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation...' and Section 3(c) requires a report to Congress within one year." —" That quote proves my point: the scope exceeds the allotted time.

" The bill states the Commission shall 'Recommend appropriate remedies' and explicitly require consideration of 'how the Government... will offer a formal apology' and 'how any form of compensation... is calculated' (Section 3(b)(7)(B),(E))." —" Vague mandate plus limited funds make precise, legally defensible remedies improbable.

Conclusion: The bill's composition, timeline, and resources make its process biased and impractical.

Model: openai/gpt-5-mini

Con argued "The bill's composition, timeline, and resources make its process biased and impractical" — that conclusion misreads the bill's design and mandate.

1. Moral and historical obligation (PART 1)
The bill states "(3) the slavery that flourished in the United States constituted an immoral and inhumane deprivation of Africans' life, liberty..." This explicit finding is the necessary factual foundation for any remedy; recognizing harm is a prerequisite to policy. Con's claim that moral findings "do not address structural biases" ignores that the bill pairs findings with procedural safeguards: "The Commission shall be composed of 13 members..." including "Three members shall be appointed by the President... Three... by the Speaker... One... by the President pro tempore... Six members shall be selected from the major civil society and reparations organizations..." (Section 4(a)(1)). That plural appointment structure promotes balance, not bias.

2. Evidence‑based policymaking mechanism (PART 1 & PART 2)
The bill states the Commission shall "Identify, compile and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation" (Section 3(b)(1)) and must report "not later than the date which is one year after the date of the first meeting" (Section 3(c)). A one‑year mandate drives timely action while Section 5(c) empowers the panel to "acquire directly from the head of any department... available information" and Section 6(c) to "procure the services of experts and consultants," enabling rigorous, evidence‑driven work within that period.

3. Structured path to concrete remedies (PART 2)
The bill explicitly requires recommendations on apology and compensation: "(B) How the Government... will offer a formal apology..." and "(E) How... any form of compensation... is calculated" (Section 3(b)(7)). The appropriation "$12,000,000" funds study operations, not reparations; contracts and expert procurement authority (Sections 5 and 6) ensure substantive, practicable recommendations rather than vague outcomes.

The bill therefore balances moral clarity, rigorous inquiry, and procedural design to produce credible, timely reparations proposals.

AI Debater Con - Round 2/5
Model: openai/gpt-5-mini

1. Biased commission composition
Pro claims "That plural appointment structure promotes balance, not bias." The bill states "Six members shall be selected from the major civil society and reparations organizations that have historically championed the cause of reparatory justice" (Section 4(a)(1)(D)). That is an explicit majority‑of‑advocates design inside a 13‑member body ("The Commission shall be composed of 13 members" Section 4(a)(1)). This textual evidence shows built‑in representational skew; impact: credibility and perceived impartiality will be undermined.

2. Unrealistic timeline & scope
Pro argues "A one‑year mandate drives timely action." The bill states the Commission "shall submit a written report... not later than the date which is one year after the date of the first meeting" (Section 3(c)) while also requiring the Commission to "Identify, compile and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation" (Section 3(b)(1)). One year cannot reasonably support comprehensive multi‑century evidence synthesis; impact: rushed, incomplete findings.

3. Insufficient funding & vague remedies
Pro wrote "The appropriation "$12,000,000" funds study operations, not reparations;" yet the bill only authorizes "$12,000,000" (Section 8) while directing complex tasks and to "procure the services of experts and consultants" (Section 6(c)). The funding cap plus broad remedy mandates risk superficial, uncredible recommendations.

Concluding sentence: The bill’s texts (composition, one‑year deadline, and $12M cap) jointly make its process structurally biased, rushed, and underresourced.

AI Debater Pro - Round 3/5
Model: openai/gpt-5-mini

1. PART 1 - Moral and historical obligation
The bill states "(3) the slavery that flourished in the United States constituted an immoral and inhumane deprivation of Africans' life, liberty..." This finding is explicit evidence the Commission must start from shared facts. The bill also states "The Commission shall be composed of 13 members" with appointments by the President, Speaker, and President pro tempore and six civil‑society seats, ensuring both governmental balance and affected‑community representation.

2. PART 1 - Evidence‑based policymaking mechanism
The bill states the Commission shall "Identify, compile and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation" and "shall submit... not later than... one year after the first meeting." Section 5(c) authorizes acquiring "available information" from agencies and Section 6(c) to "procure the services of experts and consultants," enabling rigorous, timely synthesis.

3. PART 1 - Structured path to concrete remedies
The bill states the Commission must address "(B) How the Government... will offer a formal apology" and "(E) How... any form of compensation... is calculated." Section 8 authorizes "$12,000,000" for study operations, not payouts, and Sections 6(e)(2) and 5(c) enable partnerships to extend capacity.

4. PART 2 - Refuting "That is an explicit majority‑of‑advocates design..."
Con said "That is an explicit majority‑of‑advocates design..." but the bill's mixed appointment rules and the quorum rule—"Seven members... shall constitute a quorum"—prevent single‑bloc domination while ensuring affected voices are included.

5. PART 2 - Refuting "one year cannot reasonably support..."
Con argued "one year cannot reasonably support comprehensive multi‑century evidence synthesis." The bill empowers the Commission to "acquire directly from the head of any department" and hire experts (Sections 5(c), 6(c)), allowing leverage of existing archives and scholarship to meet the deadline.

6. PART 2 - Refuting "$12,000,000" is insufficient
Con highlighted "$12,000,000"; the bill's contract authorities (Section 6(e)(2)) permit partnering with universities, agencies, and NGOs to scale research beyond the appropriation, and the detailed remedy questions (Section 3(b)(7)(A)-(G)) provide concrete analytic direction.

The bill’s balanced appointments, explicit mandates, and authorities for agency cooperation and expert contracting make it a practical, credible path to evidence‑based reparations proposals.

AI Debater Con - Round 3/5
Model: openai/gpt-5-mini

1. Biased commission composition
The bill states "The Commission shall be composed of 13 members" and "Six members shall be selected from the major civil society and reparations organizations..." This is textual evidence of a built‑in advocate bloc. Pro claimed "That plural appointment structure promotes balance, not bias." That quote misreads the text: a designated six‑seat block of reparations advocates in a 13‑member body inherently skews deliberation and public credibility, and Section 4(d) ("Seven members... shall constitute a quorum") does not negate a majority influence when agenda control and narrative framing matter.

2. Unrealistic timeline & scope
The bill states the Commission "shall submit a written report... not later than the date which is one year after the date of the first meeting" and must "Identify, compile and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation" including "the capture and procurement of Africans; the transport... the sale..." Pro said "A one‑year mandate drives timely action." The quote ignores the bill’s expansive multi‑century evidentiary demands; one year cannot produce a comprehensive, defensible synthesis across archives, hearings, and statutory analysis.

3. Insufficient funding & hidden costs
The bill states "there are authorized to be appropriated $12,000,000" while allowing pay "at the daily equivalent... GS‑18" and to "procure the services of experts and consultants." Pro argued "The appropriation "$12,000,000" funds study operations, not reparations;" but that quote sidesteps reality: $12M will not cover GS‑18–level member pay, nationwide hearings, subpoenas, archival access, and top experts—yielding underfunded, unreliable results.

Concluding sentence: The bill’s own text (composition, one‑year deadline, $12M cap) makes its process biased, rushed, and underresourced, so Con remains ahead.

Model: openai/gpt-5-mini

1. PART 1 - FRONTLINE YOUR CASE
The bill states "(3) the slavery that flourished in the United States constituted an immoral and inhumane deprivation of Africans' life, liberty..." — this textual finding establishes moral responsibility as the necessary premise for remedies.
The bill states the Commission shall "Identify, compile and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation" and "shall submit... not later than... one year after the first meeting," and Section 5(c) authorizes it to "acquire directly from the head of any department" and Section 6(c) to "procure the services of experts and consultants" — together these clauses create an evidence‑driven, time‑bounded process.
The bill states the Commission must address "(B) How the Government... will offer a formal apology" and "(E) How... any form of compensation... is calculated," while Section 8 authorizes "$12,000,000" for study operations — the mandate is concrete and resourced for study, not payouts.

2. PART 2 - CONTINUE ATTACKING CON'S CASE
Con calls the design "That is an explicit majority‑of‑advocates design" and claims the bill is "biased, rushed, and underresourced." The bill also states "Three members shall be appointed by the President. Three members shall be appointed by the Speaker... One member shall be appointed by the President pro tempore" — appointment diversity plus "Seven members... shall constitute a quorum" prevents unilateral control.
On timing, although Con labels one year "rushed," the bill's authority to "acquire directly" from agencies and to "procure... experts" makes rapid, rigorous synthesis feasible by leveraging existing records and contracted scholarship.
On funding, the bill permits contracts "with... private firms, institutions" for research (Section 6(e)(2)), showing $12M is seed funding to mobilize broader institutional capacity.

3. PART 3 - WEIGHING & EXTENSIONS
Weighing: Con's procedural worries are real but the bill's explicit text (moral finding, cross‑branch appointments, agency access, expert procurement, focused remedy questions) directly addresses those risks. The core clash is evidence and legitimacy versus perceived bias; the bill's clauses favor credible, time‑bound inquiry.
The Commission's legal authorities and mandate make Pro's position stronger: the bill creates a feasible, evidence‑based path to apology and reparatory recommendations.

AI Debater Con - Round 4/5
Model: openai/gpt-5-mini

1. FRONTLINE YOUR CASE
Pro said "That plural appointment structure promotes balance, not bias." The bill states "The Commission shall be composed of 13 members" and "Six members shall be selected from the major civil society and reparations organizations that have historically championed the cause of reparatory justice" (Section 4(a)(1)(D)). A six‑seat advocate bloc in a 13‑member body creates built‑in partiality that undermines impartial fact‑finding and public credibility.

Pro said "A one‑year mandate drives timely action." The bill states the Commission "shall submit a written report... not later than the date which is one year after the date of the first meeting" and must "Identify, compile and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation" (Sections 3(c), 3(b)(1)). The scope—multi‑century archives, hearings, statutory analysis—cannot be credibly completed in one year.

Pro said "The appropriation '$12,000,000' funds study operations, not payouts;" but the bill authorizes "there are authorized to be appropriated $12,000,000" and requires pay "at the daily equivalent... GS‑18" and to "procure the services of experts and consultants" (Sections 8, 4(f)(1), 6(c)). Those costs make $12M inadequate.

2. CONTINUE ATTACKING PRO'S CASE
Pro invoked agency access: "acquire directly from the head of any department" and "procure the services of experts" (Sections 5(c), 6(c)) as a cure. Existing archives are vast; access does not equal analysis. Rapid contracting increases risk of outsourcing to partisan vendors, amplifying the bias from the commission makeup.

Pro suggested quorum rules check dominance ("Seven members... shall constitute a quorum" Section 4(d)). Quorum does not prevent advocacy majorities from setting agendas, framing evidence, or controlling hearings.

Pro argued partnerships extend capacity (Section 6(e)(2)). But relying on unpaid or donated institutional support creates uneven data quality and increases political selection of supportive partners—again magnifying built‑in bias.

3. WEIGHING & EXTENSIONS
Textual evidence shows three structural flaws: composition ("Six members..."), timeline ("one year"), and funding ("$12,000,000") (Sections 4(a)(1)(D); 3(c); 8). These interact—biased membership plus rushed, underfunded work produces credence‑weak, politically driven recommendations. For legitimacy and defensible policy, the bill must fix composition, extend the timeline, and fund comprehensive inquiry. Con is ahead because the bill’s own language guarantees structural bias and practical infeasibility.

AI Debater Pro - Round 5/5
Model: openai/gpt-5-mini

1. PART 1 - FRONTLINE YOUR CASE
The bill states "(3) the slavery... constituted an immoral and inhumane deprivation..." which grounds moral obligation and justifies inquiry. The bill states Section 4(a)(1): "Three members shall be appointed by the President. Three members shall be appointed by the Speaker... One member shall be appointed by the President pro tempore," and Section 4(d) "Seven members... shall constitute a quorum," directly answering Con's claim "That is an explicit majority‑of‑advocates design" by showing mixed appointments and quorum safeguards. The bill states Section 3(b)(1) the Commission shall "Identify, compile and synthesize the relevant corpus..." and Section 3(c) "shall submit... not later than... one year"; Con argued "one year cannot reasonably support comprehensive multi‑century evidence synthesis" but Section 5(c) allows it to "acquire directly from the head of any department" and Section 6(c) to "procure the services of experts and consultants," enabling rapid, authoritative synthesis. The bill states Section 3(b)(7)(B),(E) to address apology and compensation and Section 8 authorizes "$12,000,000"; Con claimed "$12,000,000 will not cover GS‑18–level member pay... yielding underfunded, unreliable results," yet Section 6(e)(2) permits contracts with universities and agencies to scale capacity beyond the appropriation.

2. PART 2 - CONTINUE ATTACKING CON'S CASE
The bill states Section 5(a) it may "request the attendance and testimony of such witnesses" (subpoena aid), which counters the risk of selective evidence. The bill states Section 2(a)(4) that "a preponderance of scholarly, legal, community evidentiary documentation" exists, undermining Con's timeline objection by authorizing use of extant scholarship. The bill's contracting and interagency authorities (Sections 5(c), 6(e)(2)) mitigate the $12M concern by enabling leveraged partnerships and reimbursable administrative support.

3. PART 3 - WEIGHING & EXTENSIONS
Weighing: Con’s procedural worries are real, but the bill’s explicit text—moral finding (Sec.2(a)(3)), mixed appointments (Sec.4), agency access (Sec.5(c)), subpoena power (Sec.5(a)), expert procurement (Sec.6(c)), and focused remedy questions (Sec.3(b)(7))—creates a credible, time‑bound, and practically resourced fact‑finding process. Because the statute combines clear findings, balanced appointments, and concrete powers to gather expert evidence, Pro remains ahead.

AI Debater Con - Round 5/5
Model: openai/gpt-5-mini

1. PART 1 - FRONTLINE YOUR CASE
The bill states Section 4(a)(1)(D): "Six members shall be selected from the major civil society and reparations organizations..." This text creates a designated six‑seat advocate bloc. Pro's claim "That plural appointment structure promotes balance, not bias." is directly contradicted by this explicit majority‑of‑advocates design; Section 4(d) ("Seven members... shall constitute a quorum") does not neutralize agenda control by a cohesive advocate bloc.

The bill states Section 3(c): the Commission "shall submit a written report... not later than the date which is one year after the date of the first meeting" and Section 3(b)(1) to "Identify, compile and synthesize the relevant corpus of evidentiary documentation." Pro's claim "A one‑year mandate drives timely action." ignores the infeasibility of completing multi‑century synthesis and nationwide hearings in one year even with agency access (Section 5(c)).

The bill states Section 8: "there are authorized to be appropriated $12,000,000" and Section 4(f)(1) authorizes GS‑18‑level pay; Pro's assertion "The appropriation "$12,000,000" funds study operations, not payouts;" understates real costs—member pay, nationwide hearings, subpoenas, and expert contracts exceed this cap.

2. PART 2 - CONTINUE ATTACKING PRO'S CASE
The bill permits the Commission to "procure the services of experts and consultants" (Section 6(c)); combined with a six‑member advocate bloc, this risks partisan vendor selection and confirmation bias. Agency access (Section 5(c)) supplies archives but does not solve analysis time or resource shortages. Relying on partnerships (Section 6(e)(2)) invites uneven, selective support rather than neutral capacity.

3. PART 3 - WEIGHING & EXTENSIONS
Textually: composition (Sec.4(a)(1)(D)), timeline (Sec.3(c)), and funding (Sec.8) interact negatively—bias + rushed deadline + inadequate funds = high risk of politicized, unreliable findings. For legitimacy, the bill must change appointments, lengthen the timeline, and increase funding; until then, Con remains ahead.

Judge Feedback
1) Summary of main arguments
Pro

The bill (H.R.40) explicitly recognizes a moral and historical obligation arising from slavery; that factual finding is necessary before any remedial policy.
The Commission’s statutory design (13 members with appointments by President, Speaker, President pro tempore, plus six civil‑society seats), together with quorum rules and authorities to subpoena, acquire agency records, and hire experts, produces a balanced, evidence‑driven body.
A one‑year deadline is an appropriate time‑bound driver; existing scholarship, agency records, and contracting authority let the Commission synthesize evidence and produce practical recommendations within that period.
The $12,000,000 appropriation is seed funding for study operations; contracting, interagency cooperation, and partnerships with universities/NGOs can scale capacity beyond the appropriation to produce defensible remedies (including apology and compensation formulas).
Con

The bill explicitly reserves six of 13 seats for “major civil society and reparations organizations,” which constitutes a built‑in advocate bloc and creates a structural bias that will undermine impartiality and public credibility.
The Commission’s substantive charge—synthesizing multi‑century capture, transport, treatment, and “lingering negative effects”—is far too large to be credibly completed with thoroughness in one year, even with agency access.
The $12,000,000 authorization and member/consultant pay expectations are inadequate to support nationwide hearings, archival research, expert contracting, and defensible compensation analyses; underfunding will produce rushed or superficial findings.
These three textual features (composition, timeline, funding) interact: biased membership plus rushed, underfunded work increases the risk of politicized, unreliable recommendations.
2) Strengths and weaknesses analysis
Pro — Strengths

Uses specific statutory citations to show the Commission has a range of formal powers (agency access, subpoena/request authority, contracting for experts) that plausibly mitigate logistical obstacles.
Emphasizes the moral and policy rationale: acknowledging harms is a legitimate prerequisite to remedy design.
Highlights procedural devices (mixed appointments, quorum rules) intended to prevent unilateral control.
Frames the $12M as operational seed funding and argues the statute contemplates leveraging external institutional capacity.
Pro — Weaknesses

Relies heavily on the claim that agency access, contracting authority, and partnerships suffice to overcome time and funding constraints without offering concrete precedent, timelines, or budget breakdowns to substantiate feasibility.
Tends to conflate the existence of formal powers (e.g., subpoena, agency cooperation) with guaranteed efficacy; access does not automatically produce rapid, high‑quality synthesis.
Underestimates the significance of perceived impartiality; mixed appointments and quorum rules do not neutralize the optics or practical consequences of a six‑seat advocate bloc.
Repeats textual counterclaims but rarely translates those counters into clear empirical rebuttals (e.g., examples of similar commissions that succeeded in one year on similar scope).
Con — Strengths

Anchors argument in explicit textual facts that are hard to dispute (six designated advocacy seats; one‑year report deadline; $12M authorization). Those concrete citations give Con strong prima facie credibility.
Persuasively connects textual design features to real downstream impacts: perception of bias, practical inability to do exhaustive archival work in one year, and funding shortfalls that will shape methodology and vendor choices.
Argues interaction effects—composition × timeline × funding—rather than treating each problem in isolation; that systems thinking strengthens the practical critique.
Emphasizes legitimacy and credibility as critical policy outcomes; even a well‑researched report can fail if perceived as biased or rushed.
Con — Weaknesses

Less willing to acknowledge or rebut Pro’s concrete mitigation mechanisms (subpoena power, agency cooperation, expert contracting) with examples of those mechanisms definitively failing; largely asserts infeasibility rather than proving it by precedent or cost modeling.
Could strengthen claims with specific evidence on typical costs and time‑requirements for comparable national commissions or with case studies showing how similar commissions’ designs produced biased outcomes.
Tends to assume that advocacy appointees will cohere as a monolithic bloc—plausible but not inevitable; does not analyze vote patterns or the non‑advocate appointees’ incentives or likely independence.
3) Decision and reasoning
Winner: Con (AI Debater Con)

Reasoning (summary of weighing):

Textual advantage. Con’s central claims rest on explicit, unambiguous portions of the statute: six of 13 seats are reserved for reparations/civil‑society organizations; the report deadline is one year after first meeting; and $12,000,000 is authorized. Those are concrete constraints spelled out in the bill and therefore impose real bounds on process and optics. In a contest that turns on feasibility and institutional design, such textual facts carry heavy weight.

Impact plausibility and cumulative interaction. Pro offers meaningful procedural authorities (agency access, subpoena, contracting) that mitigate some logistical obstacles. But Con successfully shows that those authorities do not by themselves erase the key problems: scheduling and performing comprehensive, defensible, multi‑century synthesis within one year is a daunting undertaking even with agency cooperation, and $12M is unlikely to cover the full costs of nationwide hearings, high‑level expert teams, archival work, and pay expectations. When composition (a designated advocate bloc) is combined with time and resource constraints, the risk of rushed, advocacy‑framed outputs—regardless of statutory subpoena power—becomes substantial. Con’s argument that these features interact to produce a credibility problem is persuasive.

Burden of persuasion. Pro bears the burden of showing the statutory design will produce an impartial, rigorous product within the stated limits. Although Pro identified statutory tools meant to ensure rigor and balance, Pro did not provide empirical or analogical support (examples of similarly sized commissions completing comparable work in one year and on that budget) to overcome Con’s concrete, plausible impacts. Without that, Pro’s mitigation claims remain plausible but not convincing beyond doubt.

Credibility and acceptance. For a commission charged with remediating historic injustice, public legitimacy matters as much as technical thoroughness. Con persuasively argues the bill’s composition creates a perception (and a structural pathway) to biased outcomes; even a technically rigorous report could be dismissed if viewed as pre‑disposed. Pro’s quorum and cross‑branch appointment descriptions reduce but do not eliminate that perception. On matters of national reconciliation and reparations, perception of impartiality is a decisive practical factor.

Net assessment: Con’s case ties clear, textual constraints to credible negative impacts (bias perception, infeasibility, underfunding) and shows those impacts reinforce one another. Pro made earnest and legally textual rebuttals (subpoena, agency access, contracting, mixed appointments), but failed to demonstrate concretely that these mechanisms are sufficient to neutralize Con’s triplet of structural objections. Given the centrality of credibility and feasibility to the debate question, Con’s arguments are more persuasive overall.

Recommended constructive edits (if the goal is to strengthen the bill so Pro’s case would be stronger):

Reduce or reconfigure the six‑seat automatic advocate allotment (e.g., create proportional community‑stakeholder representation without guaranteed majority of advocacy organizations), or explicitly require balanced representation among civil‑society picks.
Extend the reporting timeline (one year → 18–24 months) or authorize staged interim findings and final report.
Increase appropriation or provide a clearer budget breakdown with contingency funding, so contracting, nationwide hearings, and high‑tier expert work are credibly resourced.
Add explicit procedural safeguards to promote perceived impartiality (e.g., conflict‑of‑interest rules for appointees, transparent vendor selection rules, independent peer review of final report).
These fixes would address Con’s primary impacts and substantially strengthen Pro’s feasibility and legitimacy claims.
