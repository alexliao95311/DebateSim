## üéØ Research Questions and Hypotheses

### Primary Research Question
How does prompt engineering drift affect the consistency and quality of AI-generated legislative arguments across different debate rounds, and can we develop predictive models to maintain argument coherence?

### Secondary Research Questions
1. What are the optimal Chain-of-Thought prompting strategies for different debate roles (pro, con, judge)?
2. How do different AI models perform across debate roles in legislative contexts?
3. Can we develop automated quality assessment metrics for AI-generated legislative arguments?

### Primary Hypotheses
- **H1**: Prompt drift will increase significantly across debate rounds, with semantic drift showing the strongest correlation with argument quality degradation
- **H2**: Chain-of-Thought prompting will improve logical coherence scores by at least 20% compared to standard prompting
- **H3**: Different AI models will show role-specific performance patterns, with larger models performing better in judge roles

### Secondary Hypotheses
- **H4**: Evidence integration scores will correlate positively with debate outcome prediction accuracy
- **H5**: Automated quality metrics will achieve >80% agreement with human expert evaluations
- **H6**: Prompt engineering strategies will show diminishing returns after 3 rounds of debate
