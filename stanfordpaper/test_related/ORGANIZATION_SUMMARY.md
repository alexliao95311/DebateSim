## 🚀 Quick Submission Process

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)
```bash
cd stanfordpaper/papercontent
make prepare-submission
# This creates neurips2024_submission.zip ready for OpenReview
```

### Option 2: Manual
```bash
cd stanfordpaper/papercontent
./prepare_submission.sh
# Follow the detailed steps in REPRODUCIBILITY.md
```

   make prepare-submission
   ```

3. **Submit to OpenReview**:
   - Go to https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference
   - Upload `neurips_paper_template.pdf` as main paper
   - Upload `neurips2024_submission.zip` as supplementary materials
   - Complete submission form

4. **Monitor and respond**:
   - Check OpenReview for reviewer comments
   - Address any questions about reproduction
   - Prepare for potential revision requests

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check the documentation**:
   - `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` for detailed reproduction steps
   - `SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` for submission process
   - `README.md` for quick reference

2. **Verify the setup**:
   ```bash
   make test  # Test all components
   make reproduce  # Run full reproduction
   ```

3. **Check the logs**:
   - Look for error messages in the output
   - Check `./outputs/reproduction_report.json` for detailed results

## 📊 Expected Results

The reproduction should produce results matching the paper's tables:

| Metric | Expected Range | Paper Value |
